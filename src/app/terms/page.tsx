          <p className="mb-4">
            AIMARKER provides AI-generated feedback and scoring as an
            educational tool. The AI-generated feedback is for educational
            guidance only and should not be considered a substitute for a
            teacher's assessment. Accuracy is not guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            While we strive for accuracy, AI marking should be used as a
            supplement to, not a replacement for, human teacher assessment.
            Results may vary and should be verified by qualified educators for
            official grading purposes. We are not responsible for any academic
            decisions made based solely on AI-generated feedback.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our service utilizes multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and others via OpenRouter) 
            to provide diverse marking perspectives. We continuously validate our AI accuracy through golden test datasets 
            and user feedback, but variations in AI responses are expected and normal.
